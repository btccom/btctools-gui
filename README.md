8. Trying to compile the project for 32-bit and 64-bit Release. Since the libbtctools library only compiles the Release version, it cannot be Debug compiled.

9. If you are prompted that the header file or library file cannot be found, remember to delete the temporary compilation folder, which is in the same directory as btctools-gui, and the directory name is like "build-btctools-gui-Desktop_x86_windows_msvc2022_pe_32bit-Release". The compiled exe is also located here.
